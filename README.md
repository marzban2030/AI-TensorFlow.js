# AI-TensorFlow.js
Simple AI Neural Network by TensorFlow in JavaScript language 

All of TensorFlow.js examples and demoes in the web are complicated and confusing, But this project is consist of few codes which make it easy to understanding.

Complicated full project with visual environment is available in my another repository at:
https://github.com/marzban2030/TensorFlow.js-vis

Because of hardware resource limitations in common todays systems such as GPU texture size limit to running webGL I put below code lines in "model.js" file inorder to reducing GPU hardware resource usage by shortening training and testing data tensors to under 10%:
